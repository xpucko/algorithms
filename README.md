## Bubble Sort.
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm and is used primarily as an educational tool.
