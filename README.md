# Sorting algorithms.
## Bubble Sort.
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm and is used primarily as an educational tool.

### Selection Sort.
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element  from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array. In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depends on the data in the array. Time Complexity is O(n2) as there are two nested loops.
